# Try Out Development Containers: .NET

[![Open in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-dotnet)


A **development container** is a running container with a well-defined tool/runtime stack and its prerequisites. You can try out development containers with **[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)** or **[Visual Studio Code Dev Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers)**.

This is a sample project that lets you try out either option in a few easy steps. We have a variety of other [vscode-remote-try-*](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Amicrosoft+vscode-remote-try-&type=Repositories) sample projects, too.

> **Note:** If you already have a Codespace or dev container, you can jump to the [Things to try](#things-to-try) section.

## Setting up the development container

### GitHub Codespaces
Follow these steps to open this sample in a Codespace:
1. Click the **Code** drop-down menu.
2. Click on the **Codespaces** tab.
3. Click **Create codespace on main** .

For more info, check out the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/creating-a-codespace#creating-a-codespace).

### VS Code Dev Containers

If you already have VS Code and Docker installed, you can click the badge above or [here](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-dotnet) to get started. Clicking these links will cause VS Code to automatically install the Dev Containers extension if needed, clone the source code into a container volume, and spin up a dev container for use.

Follow these steps to open this sample in a container using the VS Code Dev Containers extension:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please ensure your system meets the pre-reqs (i.e. have Docker installed) in the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started).

2. To use this repository, you can either open the repository in an isolated Docker volume:

    - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Dev Containers: Try a Sample...** command.
    - Choose the ".NET Core" sample, wait for the container to start, and try things out!
        > **Note:** Under the hood, this will use the **Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command to clone the source code in a Docker volume instead of the local filesystem. [Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) are the preferred mechanism for persisting container data.

   Or open a locally cloned copy of the code:

   - Clone this repository to your local filesystem.
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...** command.
   - Select the cloned copy of this folder, wait for the container to start, and try things out!

3. If you want to enable **HTTPS**, see [enabling HTTPS](#enabling-https) to reuse your local development cert in the container.

## Things to try

Once you have this sample opened, you'll be able to work with it like you would locally.

Some things to try:

1. **Restore Packages:** When notified by the C# extension to install packages, click Restore to trigger the process from inside the container! You can also execute `dotnet restore` command in a terminal.

2. **Edit:**
   - Open `Program.cs`
   - Try adding some code and check out the language features.
   - Make a spelling mistake and notice it is detected. The [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) extension was automatically installed because it is referenced in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.
   - Also notice that the [C#](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) extension is installed. Tools are installed in the `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/dotnet` image and Dev Container settings and metadata are automatically picked up from [image labels](https://containers.dev/implementors/reference/#labels).


4. **Build, Run, and Debug:**
   - Open `Program.cs`
   - Add a breakpoint (e.g. on line 16).
   - Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch the app in the container.
   - Navigate to the weather endpoint, for example, [http://localhost:5000/paris/weather](http://localhost:5000/paris/weather).
   - Once the breakpoint is hit, try hovering over variables, examining locals, and more.   
   - Continue (<kbd>F5</kbd>). You can connect to the server in the container by either: 
      - Clicking on `Open in Browser` in the notification telling you: `Your service running on port 5000 is available`.
      - Clicking the globe icon in the 'Ports' view. The 'Ports' view gives you an organized table of your forwarded ports, and you can access it with the command **Ports: Focus on Ports View**.
    - Notice port 5000 in the 'Ports' view is labeled "Hello Remote World." In `devcontainer.json`, you can set `"portsAttributes"`, such as a label for your forwarded ports and the action to be taken when the port is autoforwarded.

   > **Note:** In Dev Containers, you can access your app at `http://localhost:5000` in a local browser. But in a browser-based Codespace, you must click the link from the notification or the `Ports` view so that the service handles port forwarding in the browser and generates the correct URL.

5. **Rebuild or update your container**

   You may want to make changes to your container, such as installing a different version of a software or forwarding a new port. You'll rebuild your container for your changes to take effect. 

   **Open browser automatically:** As an example change, let's update the `portsAttributes` in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file to open a browser when our port is automatically forwarded.
   
   - Open the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file.
   - Modify the `"onAutoForward"` attribute in your `portsAttributes` from `"notify"` to `"openBrowser"`.
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Dev Containers: Rebuild Container** or **Codespaces: Rebuild Container** command so the modifications are picked up.

5. **Install Node.js using a Dev Container Feature:**
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Dev Containers: Configure Container Features...** or **Codespaces: Configure Container Features...** command.
   - Type "node" in the text box at the top.
   - Check the check box next to "Node.js (via nvm) and yarn" (published by devcontainers) 
   - Click OK
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Dev Containers: Rebuild Container** or **Codespaces: Rebuild Container** command so the modifications are picked up.
