# Try Out Development Containers: .NET Core

[![Open in Remote - Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Remote%20-%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-dotnetcore)

A **development container** is a running [Docker](https://www.docker.com) container with a well-defined tool/runtime stack and its prerequisites. You can try out development containers with **[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)** or **[Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers)**.

This is a sample project that lets you try out either option in a few easy steps. We have a variety of other [vscode-remote-try-*](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Amicrosoft+vscode-remote-try-&type=Repositories) sample projects, too.

> **Note:** If you already have a Codespace or dev container, you can jump to the [Things to try](#things-to-try) section.

## Setting up the development container

### GitHub Codespaces
Follow these steps to open this sample in a Codespace:
1. Click the Code drop-down menu and select the **Open with Codespaces** option.
1. Select **+ New codespace** at the bottom on the pane.

For more info, check out the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/creating-a-codespace#creating-a-codespace).

### VS Code Remote - Containers

If you already have VS Code and Docker installed, you can click the badge above or [here](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-dotnetcore) to get started. Clicking these links will cause VS Code to automatically install the Remote - Containers extension if needed, clone the source code into a container volume, and spin up a dev container for use.

Follow these steps to open this sample in a container using the VS Code Remote - Containers extension:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please ensure your system meets the pre-reqs (i.e. have Docker installed) in the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started).

2. To use this repository, you can either open the repository in an isolated Docker volume:

    - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Try a Sample...** command.
    - Choose the ".NET Core" sample, wait for the container to start, and try things out!
        > **Note:** Under the hood, this will use the **Remote-Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command to clone the source code in a Docker volume instead of the local filesystem. [Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) are the preferred mechanism for persisting container data.

   Or open a locally cloned copy of the code:

   - Clone this repository to your local filesystem.
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...** command.
   - Select the cloned copy of this folder, wait for the container to start, and try things out!

3. If you want to enable **HTTPS**, see [enabling HTTPS](#enabling-https) to reuse your local development cert in the container.

## Things to try

Once you have this sample opened, you'll be able to work with it like you would locally.

> **Note:** This container runs as a non-root user with sudo access by default. Comment out `"remoteUser": "vscode"` in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` if you'd prefer to run as root.

Some things to try:

1. **Restore Packages:** When notified by the C# extension to install packages, click Restore to trigger the process from inside the container!

2. **Edit:**
   - Open `Program.cs`
   - Try adding some code and check out the language features.

3. **Terminal:** Press <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> and type `dotnet --version` and other Linux commands from the terminal window.

4. **Build, Run, and Debug:**
   - Open `Program.cs`
   - Add a breakpoint (e.g. on line 21).
   - Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch the app in the container.
   - Once the breakpoint is hit, try hovering over variables, examining locals, and more.   
   - Continue (<kbd>F5</kbd>). You can connect to the server in the container by either: 
      - Clicking on `Open in Browser` in the notification telling you: `Your service running on port 5000 is available`.
      - Clicking the globe icon in the 'Ports' view. The 'Ports' view gives you an organized table of your forwarded ports, and you can access it with the command **Ports: Focus on Ports View**.
    - Notice port 5000 in the 'Ports' view is labeled "Hello Remote World." In `devcontainer.json`, you can set `"portsAttributes"`, such as a label for your forwarded ports and the action to be taken when the port is autoforwarded.

   > **Note:** In Remote - Containers, you can access your app at `http://localhost:5000` in a local browser. But in a browser-based Codespace, you must click the link from the notification or the `Ports` view so that the service handles port forwarding in the browser and generates the correct URL.

5. **Rebuild or update your container**

   You may want to make changes to your container, such as installing a different version of a software or forwarding a new port. You'll rebuild your container for your changes to take effect. 

   **Open browser automatically:** As an example change, let's update the `portsAttributes` in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file to open a browser when our port is automatically forwarded.
   
   - Open the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file.
   - Modify the `"onAutoForward"` attribute in your `portsAttributes` from `"notify"` to `"openBrowser"`.
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container** or **Codespaces: Rebuild Container** command so the modifications are picked up.

### Enabling HTTPS

To enable HTTPS for this sample, you can mount an exported copy of a locally generated dev certificate. Note that these instructions assume you already have the `dotnet` CLI installed on your local operating system.

1. Enable HTTPS in the sample by updating the `env` property in `.vscode/launch.json` as follows:

   ```json
   "env": {
         "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "HttpsDevelopment"
   }
   ```

2. Next, export the SSL cert using the following command:

    **Windows PowerShell**

    ```powershell
    dotnet dev-certs https --trust; dotnet dev-certs https -ep "$env:USERPROFILE/.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx" -p "SecurePwdGoesHere"
    ```

    **macOS/Linux terminal**

    ```powershell
    dotnet dev-certs https --trust; dotnet dev-certs https -ep "${HOME}/.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx" -p "SecurePwdGoesHere"
    ```

3. Add the following in to `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:

    ```json
    "remoteEnv": {
        "ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password": "SecurePwdGoesHere",
        "ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path": "/home/vscode/.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx",
    }
    ```

4. Finally, make the certificate available in the container as follows:

    **If using GitHub Codespaces and/or Remote - Containers**

    1. Start the container/codespace
    2. Drag `~/.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx` from your local machine into the root of the File Explorer in VS Code.
    3. Open a terminal in VS Code and run:
        ```bash
        mkdir -p /home/vscode/.aspnet/https && mv aspnetapp.pfx /home/vscode/.aspnet/https
        ```

    **If using only Remote - Containers with a local container**

    Add the following to `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:

    ```json
    "mounts": [ "source=${env:HOME}${env:USERPROFILE}/.aspnet/https,target=/home/vscode/.aspnet/https,type=bind" ]
    ```

5. If you've already opened your folder in a container, rebuild the container using the **Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container** command from the Command Palette (<kbd>F1</kbd>) so the settings take effect.

Next time you debug using VS Code (<kbd>F5</kbd>), you'll be able to use HTTPS! Note that you will need to specifically navigate to `https://localhost:5001` to get the certificate to work (**not** `https://127.0.0.1:5001`).
